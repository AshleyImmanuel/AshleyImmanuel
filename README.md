Hi there, I'm @AshleyImmanuel! 👋
👀 About Me

I’m currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Computer Science (Data Analytics) Honors at Rajagiri College of Social Sciences (Autonomous). I have a strong foundation in Python, MySQL, and Networking Concepts gained during my studies at Kendriya Vidyalaya Kadavanthra. Additionally, I’ve explored the basics of C and C++ (excluding OOP concepts) from LCC Aluva and have recently started studying Rust using online platforms.

🏆 Achievements

I’m passionate about coding and have actively participated in numerous competitions:
Second Prize at DIGNITO'24 (Clueless Coders) held at De Paul College Angamaly during my first semester.
Second Prize at Techscape (Cochin College) in my second semester, competing against senior UG and PG students.
Successfully took on the challenge of learning Rust within an hour at Aloki25 and applied it to solve coding problems.
Participated in the Zynapse Debugging Competition at Bharata Mata College, Thrikkakara.


🌱 Current Learning


I’m currently expanding my skills in Data Analytics and Rust programming. I’m also exploring new technologies and staying updated on advancements in Software Development, AI and Machine Learning, Data Science, and Cybersecurity.

💞️ Collaboration


I’m enthusiastic about working on projects that push boundaries and solve real-world problems. I’m particularly interested in collaborating on:

Software Engineering: Developing efficient and scalable applications, problem-solving, and contributing to open-source projects.
Data Analytics: Extracting insights from data, visualizing trends, and making data-driven decisions.
AI and Machine Learning: Building intelligent systems, developing predictive models, and applying AI to solve practical problems.
Cybersecurity: Enhancing digital security, ethical hacking, and securing software applications.
System Programming: Exploring low-level programming using languages like C, C++, and Rust.
